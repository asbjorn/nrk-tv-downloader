NRK-TV-Downloader
======================
This is just another simple shell-script that dumps HLS video streams from NRK-TV into a h264-MPEG-4 container.
The script is using ffmpeg, or curl as a fallback (not the best option) 
This script has nothing to do with NRK!
It is only meant for private use, and I am not responsible for anyone's use of it. 
Because the script relies on "HTML-Parsing" it can break at any time.


This script may be useful for those who are struggeling with low bandwidth and/or bad playback performance.

Current version: 0.5.0
